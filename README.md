## My process

### Built with

- HTML DOM
- CSS Media Querys
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
this challenge it was more difficult. Use Javascript and HTML DOM was interesting and i learned how to use it. also, i learned media queries (only the basic). but i think it could be coding with less code, i'll be gratefull about your comments for this.


### Useful resources

- [HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) - This helped me to modify HTML by JS
- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - Here i could find information about CSS Media Queries
